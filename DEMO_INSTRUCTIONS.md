4. **Add security measures** for sensitive student data

## 📝 Current Mock Data

```javascript
const mockInstituteData = [
  {
    studentId: 'STU001',
    name: 'John Doe',
    dateOfBirth: '2000-05-15',
    institute: 'Tech University',
    department: 'Computer Science',
    year: '3rd Year'
  },
  // ... more students
];
```
